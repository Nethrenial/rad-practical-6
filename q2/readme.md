# RAD Practical for Express and Multer

## Important notes

- I am using a hosted mongodb database at atlas, and I've stored the connection URI in .env file
- I'm also using imagekit to store images and serve as a CDN, it's credentials are also in .env file.
- For security purposes, I won't be incuding it (.env) here, so you won't be able to run it without providing your own credentials in the given .env.example format.

- However, I've hosted it live in this domain, <a href="https://2208-rad-express-multer.fly.dev/" target="_blank">https://2208-rad-express-multer.fly.dev/</a>
